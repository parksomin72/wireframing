# Introduction to Wireframing

## What is Wireframing?

Wireframing is a key step in the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) design process. It involves creating simplified visual representations—or "blueprints"—of a digital product’s layout and structure before the actual design and development begin.

## Why is Wireframing Important?

Wireframes help designers and developers:
- Visualize the structure and flow of an interface early in the design process.
- Identify usability issues before investing time in detailed designs or coding.
- Communicate ideas clearly across teams and stakeholders.
- Save time and resources by iterating quickly on basic layout ideas.

## Low-Fidelity vs High-Fidelity Wireframes

- **Low-Fidelity**: Simple, sketch-like mockups focusing on structure and layout.
- **High-Fidelity**: Detailed, interactive versions that closely resemble the final product.

Wireframing serves as the foundation for effective and user-friendly product design, helping teams stay aligned and reduce development risks
